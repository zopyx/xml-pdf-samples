    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the man called his wife`s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with [the help of] Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother`s keeper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother`s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother`s blood from thy hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his brother`s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, [said she], God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">because all those men that have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">But your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</VERS>
